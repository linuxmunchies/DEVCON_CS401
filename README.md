# DEVCON_CS401
Developer Container for Rust Development. Initially created strictly for class, but I've found myself using this dev environment for other things as well!
You are free to copy, modify, or otherwise redistribute everything here. Thanks for taking a look! =)
Do note I am a fan of the ZSH shell, so this container will engage ZSH by default. Sorry not sorry!
